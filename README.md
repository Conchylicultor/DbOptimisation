SC Examples
===============

This repository contains example Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) defined using SC framework.

In order to learn how to develop DSLs using SC, first have a look at the [development process](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-examples/wiki/Development-process) of an embedded DSL.

We concretely demonstrate this development process through a [toy example](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-examples/blob/master/vector-dsl/README.md) (defining a DSL for working with Vectors).
