SC Examples
===============

This repository contains example Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) defined using SC framework.

In order to learn how to develop DSLs using SC, first have a look at the [development process](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-examples/wiki/Development-process) of an embedded DSL.

We concretely demonstrate this development process through two toy examples:
 * the [List](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-examples/blob/master/newtuto) tutorial: using quasiquotes to define lowerings and offline optimization on a simple `List` class, and converting it to simple C-like memory management
 * the [Vector](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-examples/blob/master/vector-dsl) tutorial: defining a DSL for working with Vectors
